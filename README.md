# Flight Delay Prediction and Operational Risk Modeling

This project develops machine learning models to predict flight delays and identify key operational and environmental risk drivers.

## Overview
- Models used: Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, Logistic Regression  
- Data sources: airline schedules, weather data, and air traffic volumes  
- Objective: Predict flight delay probability and uncover major operational risk factors  

## Methods
- Feature engineering: weather, air traffic, and airport-specific variables  
- Model training: hyperparameter tuning and cross-validation  
- Evaluation: precision, recall, AUC metrics  

## Files
- `flight_delay_code.ipynb`: main Jupyter notebook with code  
- `Airlines.xlsx`, `airports.xlsx`, `runways.xlsx`: input datasets  

## Key Insights
- Weather and air traffic density are the most influential delay predictors.  
- The model provides a foundation for real-time operational risk assessment.

## Tech Stack
Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, XGBoost, Jupyter Notebook
